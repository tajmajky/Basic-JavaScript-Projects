    <!-- Defer attribute-->
    <!-- Like the async attribute, the defer attribute is only used on external scripts.  Additionally, the document.write() method will not work 
        when using the defer attribute either.  If you use this method in your JavaScript file, you should place your <script> element above the closing body 
        tag instead of using the defer attribute.-->
<script src="JS/defer1.js" async></script> <!-- Defer1 attribute, The entire document would load, and then the defer_1.js file would be executed before the defer_2.js file.  If those same scripts had the async attribute, the script files would be loaded and executed as soon as they were ready.  This could mean that defer_2.js could execute before defer_1.js.-->
<script src="JS/defer2.js" async></script> <!-- Defer2 attribute-->
