<!--As a reminder, CDN is short for “content delivery network”. 
    A CDN is a network that delivers web pages to a user, based on the location of the user, the origin of the webpage and the server.
    It is common to reference CDNs within code so that various frameworks and libraries can be accessed.
    Meaning, instead of downloading and installing React, you can also link to it via a URL. You would do this by writing this code 
    within the <head> element:
        
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>

<!--We are calling built in React methods and functions.
    Some of the code above is React-specific, including:
    React.createClass – creates component classes
    ReactDOM.render() – used to render a React Component or Components
    React.createFactory – a function that generates a factory (object that can create other objects)-->
<!--setInterval() – a method that evaluates an expression at specified intervals (milliseconds)
    Using the above React code, we created a timer that counts upward.  -->
