    <!--The above code is an HTML file that contains JavaScript code to create a simple React component. Here's what the code does:

The HTML file includes the necessary meta tags and imports the React and React DOM libraries from a CDN.
The JavaScript code defines a class-based component called likeButton.
The likeButton component has a constructor that initializes the component state with an object that has a liked property set to false.
The likeButton component also has a render method that determines what content to render based on the value of the liked property in the component state.
If the liked property is true, the render method returns a string that says "You clicked the like button!".
If the liked property is false, the render method returns a button element that has an onClick event listener that updates the component state by setting liked to true.
The JavaScript code also creates a reference to the React.createElement function for convenience, which is assigned to the variable X.
Finally, the JavaScript code is wrapped in a script tag, which allows it to be executed in the context of the HTML document when it is loaded in a web browser.-->
