<!--You can also run React from the Command Line but first, you must ensure you have the latest version of Node.js installed because it utilizes that.

        React is run from the Command Line (to open command line terminal press CTRL + ') by typing the following commands:

        npx create-react-app my-app
        cd my-app
        npm start  -->
